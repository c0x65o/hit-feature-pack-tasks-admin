    # Scope modes:
    # - none: deny all access for this verb/entity (hide pages + block APIs)
    # - all: ignore scope (read everything)
    # - own: only owned records (not applicable for list/results - they don't have ownership fields)
    # - ldd: owner OR matching L/D/D (not applicable for list/results - they don't have LDD fields)
    #
    # These are mutually exclusive per node; the Security Groups UI renders them as dropdowns.
    # Note: List and results are system-level entities without ownership or LDD fields,
    # so `own` and `ldd` modes deny access (only `all` mode allows access).
